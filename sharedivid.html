Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 100<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 110<br />
∴ No of shares purchased = \(\frac { 8800 }{ 110 }\) = 80<br />
Nominal value of 80 shares = 80 × 100= ₹ 8,000<br />
Let dividend% = y%<br />
then y% of ₹ 8,000 = ₹ 1,200<br />

(ii) the dividend he receives annually.<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 24<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 24+ 12% of ₹ 24<br />
= ₹ 24+ ₹ 2.88= ₹ 26.88<br />
Total investment = ₹ 1,680<br />
∴ No of shares purchased = \(\frac { 1680 }{ 26.88 }\) = 62.5<br />
Nominal value of 62.5 shares = 62.5 x 24= ₹ 1,500<br />
Dividend = 15% of ₹ 1,500<br />
= \(\frac { 15 }{ 100 }\) × 1,500 = ₹ 225</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 15.</strong></span><br />

<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 25<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 40<br />
Profit% on investment = 4%<br />
Then profit on 1 share = 4% of ₹ 40= ₹ 1.60<br />
∴ Dividend% = \(\frac { 1.60 }{ 25 }\) × 100% = 6.4%<br />
No. of shares purchased= 60<br />
Then dividend on 60 shares = 60 × ₹ 1.60 = ₹ 96</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 3.</strong></span><br />
Hundred rupee shares of a company are available in the market at a premium of ₹ 20. Find the rate of dividend given by the company, when a man&#8217;s return on his investment is 15%.<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 100<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 100 + ₹ 20 = ₹ 120<br />
Profit% on investment of 1 share =15%<br />
Then profit= 15% of ₹ 120 = ₹ 18<br />
∴ Dividend% = \(\frac { 18 }{ 100 }\) × 100% = 18%</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 4.</strong></span><br />
₹ 50 shares of a company are quoted at a discount of 10%. Find the rate of dividend given by the company, the return on the investment on these shares being 20 percent.<br />

Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 50<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 50 &#8211; 10% of ₹ 50<br />
= ₹ 50 &#8211; ₹ 5 = ₹ 45<br />
Profit % on investment = 20%<br />
Then profit on 1 share = 20% of ₹ 45 = ₹ 9<br />
∴ Dividend% = \(\frac { 9 }{ 50 }\) × 100% = 18%</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 5.</strong></span><br />
A company declares 8 percent dividend to the share holders. If a man receives ₹ 2,840 as his dividend, find the nominal value of his shares.<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
Dividend% = 8%<br />
Dividend = ₹ 2,840<br />
Let nominal value of shares = ₹ y<br />
then 8% of y = ₹ 2,840<br />
⇒ \(\frac { 8 }{ 100 }\) × y = ₹ 2,840<br />
⇒ y = ₹ 35000</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 6.</strong></span><br />

Dividend% = 12%<br />
Dividend = ₹ 1,680<br />
<a ><img src="image/sd11.jpg"></a>
<p></p>
Then market value of 140 shares= 140 × 110 = ₹ 15,400</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 7.</strong></span><br />
A company declares a dividend of 11.2% to all its share-holders. If its ₹ 60 share is available in the market at a premium of 25%, how much should Rakesh invest, in buying the shares of this company, in order to have an annual income of ₹ 1,680?<br />

Market value of 1 share = ₹ 120<br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 100<br />
Dividend = 5%<br />
Income on ₹ 120 = 5% of ₹ 100 = ₹ 5<br />
Income on ₹ 1 = \(\frac { 5 }{ 120 }\) = ₹ 0.041<br />
2nd firm<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 132<br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 100<br />
Dividend = 6%<br />
Income on ₹ 132 = 6% of ₹ 100 = ₹ 6<br />
Income on ₹ 1 = \(\frac { 6 }{ 132 }\) = ₹ 0.045<br />
Then investment in second company is giving better return.<br />
(ii) Income on investment of ₹ 26,400 in fi₹ t firm<br />
= \(\frac { 5 }{ 120 }\) × 26,400 = ₹ 1,100<br />
Income on investment of ₹ 26,400 in second firm<br />
= \(\frac { 6 }{ 132 }\) × 26,400 = ₹ 1,200<br />
∴ Difference between both returns = ₹ 1,200 &#8211; ₹ 1,100 = ₹ 100</p>

A man bought 360, ten-rupee shares of a company, paying 12% per annum. He sold the shares when their price rose to ₹ 21 per share and invested the proceeds in five-rupee shares paying 4.5 percent per annum at ₹ 3.50 per share. Find the annual change in his income.<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
1st case<br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 10<br />
Nominal value of 360 shares = ₹ 10 × 360 = ₹ 3,600<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 21<br />
Market value of 360 shares = ₹ 21 × 360 = ₹ 7,560<br />
Dividend% = 12%<br />
Dividend = 12% of ₹ 3,600<br />
= \(\frac { 12 }{ 100 }\) × 3,600 = ₹ 432<br />
2nd case<br />
Nominal value of 1 share= ₹ 5<br />
Market value of 1 share= ₹ 3.50<br />
∴ No of shares purchased = \(\frac { 7,560 }{ 3.50 }\) = 2,160 shares<br />
Nominal value of 2160 shares=₹ 5 × 2160= ₹ 10,800<br />
Dividend%= 4.5%<br />
Dividend= 4.5% of ₹ 10,800<br />
= \(\frac { 4.5 }{ 132 }\) × 10,800 = ₹ 486<br />
Annual change in income = ₹ 486 &#8211; ₹ 432<br />
= ₹ 54 increase</p>

A man sold 400 (₹ 20) shares of a company, paying 5% at ₹ 18 and invested the proceeds in (₹ 10) shares of another company paying 7% at ₹ 12. How many (₹ 10) shares did he buy and what was the change in his income?<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
1st case<br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 20<br />
Nominal value of 400 shares = ₹ 20 x 400= ₹ 8,000<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 18<br />
Market value of 400 shares = ₹ 18 x 400= ₹ 7,200<br />
Dividend% = 5%<br />
Dividend = 5% of ₹ 8,000<br />
= \(\frac { 5 }{ 100 }\) × 8,000 = ₹ 400<br />
2nd case<br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 10<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 12<br />
∴ No of shares purchased = \(\frac { 7,200 }{ 12 }\) = 600 shares<br />
Nominal value of 600 shares = ₹ 10 x 600 = ₹ 6,000<br />
Dividend% = 7%<br />
Dividend = 7% of ₹ 6,000<br />
= \(\frac { 7 }{ 100 }\) × 6,000 = ₹ 420<br />
Annual change in income = ₹ 420 &#8211; ₹ 400<br />
= ₹ 20 increase</p>

Two brothers A and B invest ₹ 16,000 each in buying shares of two companies. A buys 3% hundred-rupee shares at 80 and B buys ten-rupee shares at par. If they both receive equal dividend at the end of the year, find the rate per cent of the dividend received by B.<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
For A<br />
Total investment = ₹ 16,000<br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 100<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 80<br />
∴ No of shares purchased = \(\frac { 16,000 }{ 80 }\) = 200 shares<br />
Nominal value of 200 shares = ₹ 100 × 200 = ₹ 20,000<br />
Dividend% = 3%<br />
Dividend = 3% of ₹ 20,000<br />
= \(\frac { 3 }{ 100 }\) × 20,000 = ₹ 600<br />
For B<br />
Total investment= ₹ 16,000<br />
Nominal value of 1 share= ₹ 10<br />
Market value of 1 share= ₹ 10<br />
∴ No of shares purchased = \(\frac { 16,000 }{ 10 }\) = 1600 shares<br />
Nominal value of 1600shares= 10 × 1600= ₹ 16,000<br />
Dividend received by B = Dividend received by A = ₹ 600<br />

(i) the number of shares he buys.<br />
(ii) the dividend he receives annually.<br />
(iii) the rate of interest he gets on his money.<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
Total investment = ₹ 20,020<br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 26<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 26+ 10% of ₹ 26<br />
= ₹ 26+ ₹ 2.60 = ₹ 28.60<br />
∴ No of shares purchased = \(\frac { 20,020 }{ 28.60 }\) = 700 shares<br />
Nominal value of 700 shares= ₹ 26 x 700 = ₹ 18,200<br />
Dividend% = 15%<br />
Dividend = 15% of ₹ 18,200<br />
= \(\frac { 15 }{ 100 }\) × 18,200 = ₹ 2,730<br />

(i) the number of shares he still holds;<br />
(ii) the dividend due to him on these remaining shares.<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
(i) Total investment = ₹ 45,000<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 125<br />
∴ No of shares purchased = \(\frac { 45,000 }{ 125 }\) = 360 shares<br />
Nominal value of 360 shares = ₹ 100 × 360= ₹ 36,000<br />
Let no. of shares sold = n<br />
Then sale price of 1 share = ₹ 140<br />
Total sale price of n shares = ₹ 8,400<br />
Then n = \(\frac { 8,400 }{ 140 }\) = 60 shares<br />
The no. of shares he still holds = 360 &#8211; 60 = 300<br />
(ii) Nominal value of 300 shares = ₹ 100 × 300 = ₹ 30,000<br />

(iii) the change in his annual income from dividend.<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
1st case<br />
Total investment = ₹ 4,500<br />
Market value of 1 share = ₹ 15<br />
∴ No of shares purchased = \(\frac { 4,500 }{ 15 }\) = 300 shares<br />
Nominal value of 1 share = ₹ 10<br />
Nominal value of 300 shares = ₹ 10 × 300= ₹ 3,000<br />
Dividend = 8% of ₹ 3,000<br />
= \(\frac { 8 }{ 100 }\) × 3,000 = ₹ 240<br />
Sale price of 1 share = ₹ 30<br />
Total sale price= ₹ 30 × 300= ₹ 9,000<br />
(ii) new market price of 1 share= ₹ 125<br />

(ii) The profit earned including his dividend.<br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br />
Rate of dividend = 8%<br />
Investment = ₹ 52000<br />
Market Rate = ₹ 100 &#8211; 20 = ₹ 80<br />
No. of shares purchased = \(\frac { 52000 }{ 80 }\) = 650<br />
(i) Annual dividend = 650 × 8 = ₹ 5200<br />
(ii) On selling, market rate = ₹ 100+20 = ₹ 120<br />
⇒ Sale price = 650 × 120 = ₹ 78000<br />
